    <h1>The Hidden Cost of Eggs</h1>
    <p>Unpacking the environmental, economic, and ethical consequences of egg production</p>
      <p>Eggs are a staple in diets around the world, but behind their affordability and availability lies a complex network of economic, environmental, and ethical issues. From industrial-scale farming practices to global health concerns, the true cost of eggs extends far beyond their price tag.</p>

      <h2>The Environmental Cost of Eggs</h2>
      <p>
      Egg production contributes approximately 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions from animal agriculture.
        Producing a dozen eggs requires about 53 liters of water and 2.7 kWh of energy. 
        While some farms have adopted sustainable practices, 
        such as composting manure to reduce methane emissions and using biodegradable packaging, 
        these measures are not yet widespread.

      <h2>The Social Cost of Eggs</h2>
      <p>
 The speed at which manure and waste of the chickens is produced in industrial farms is extremely toxic and can have adverse affects on many local communities. For example, in Malcom, Iowa, residents like Carolyn Bittner live near massive egg farms housing over 7.5 million chickens. These operations produce significant amounts of manure, leading to air pollution and health issues for nearby communities. The lack of stringent regulations often leaves residents with limited recourse against these megafarms.

      <h2>Health and Disease Risks</h2>
      <p>Egg production poses public health challenges, including the spread of avian flu. The CDC reports growing concerns over H5N1 infections in both wild and domestic animals, sparking responses from health authorities. The interconnectedness of the poultry supply chain makes disease outbreaks especially dangerous. H5N1 has been detected in over 48 states and poses potential risks for zoonotic transmission.</p>

      <h2>The Economics of Egg Production</h2>
      <p>Egg prices have surged due to inflation, tariffs, and outbreaks. 
        However, monopolistic control in the industry exacerbates the issue.
        According to a <a href="https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/RPT2_2502_EconomicCostEggs.pdf">2025 Food & Water Watch report</a>
        , just four companies control over 50% of the U.S. egg market: Cal-Maine Foods, Rose Acre Farms, Versova, and Hillandale Farms. 
        These corporations exploit economies of scale while externalizing environmental and ethical costs. 
        Cal-Maine alone posted over $3 billion in revenue in 2024. While the egg industry is signficantly less concentrated than beef production, it is far from ideal and is still susceptible to monopolistic abuse.

      <h2>The Supply Chain</h2>
      <p>Eggs are distributed quickly and with little time flexibility. Once hens are no longer productive, they are often sent to landfills or processed for pet food. The life of a hen The COVID-19 pandemic revealed vulnerabilities in processing and distribution, calling for decentralized, resilient systems and better disease mitigation practices.
      By the 1960s egg and poultry production had fully industrialized, with eggs and poultry being one of the most efficient in the protein industry. This resulted primarily from demand for cheaper and more uniform and standardized products from consumers, and the rise of the United Egg Producers (Cal-Maine Foods, Rose Acre Farms, and Versova) producing many of the eggs seen on store shelves.</p>

      <h2>What You Can Do</h2>
      <p>You can reduce your environmental and ethical footprint by supporting local, pasture-raised egg producers, or choosing plant-based alternatives like tofu and flaxseed. You can choose to buy eggs at a local farmers market, visit local farms for eggs, or if you. Reducing reliance on industrial-scale egg production helps shift demand toward more sustainable practices.
      You can also <a href="https://www.thefarmliving.com/raising-chickens-backyard-for-eggs/">raise your own chickens</a>, though this does require access to adequate resources like money, land, and time in order to manage and raise the chickens properly.
